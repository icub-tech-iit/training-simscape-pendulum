üë®‚Äçüî¨ Modeling a Pendulum in MATLAB
=================================

This repository contains the material required to support the hands-on that walks you through the basic steps
for modeling a physical system in MATLAB/Simulink.

### üî¢ Basic Steps
1. Sketch out the system on the paper and derive the **governing equations**.
2. Solve the **ODE problem** in MATLAB.
3. **Simplify modeling** by using Simulink.
4. Don't model it, just **build it** and **show it** in Simscape.
5. Carry out a **back-to-back comparison**.
6. Building a **double pendulum** is as easy as counting 1,2,3.
7. Let's **control** the pendulum.
8. Perpetual motion doesn't exist actually, better off **damping the pendulum**.

With MATLAB you can design, simulate, and implement controllers for more complicated systems such as an [inverted pendulum](https://mathworks.com/videos/inverted-pendulum-control-with-simmechanics-and-quarc-106862.html).

### üéì Assignment
Copy out `step_8.slx` into `step_9.slx`. Then, use `step_9.slx` to develop a controller that will let the pendulum rotate at a constant velocity.  

To complete the assignment do:
1. [Generate][1] a copy of this repository into your own account. Tick in the option "include all branches" ‚úî
1. [Create the branch][2] `solution` off of the branch `master`.
1. [Commit][3] into the branch `solution` the following files:
    1. the model `step_9.slx`;
    1. a screenshot of the graph of the angle velocity.
1. [Push][4]/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request][5] (**PR**) with `master` as _base branch_ and `solution` as _compare branch_.
1. [Request to review your PR][6] üëã to turn in the assignment.
